# NotionConverterWord
 Primitive Notion Converter to tie me over until Notion API launches
 
Requires selenium and pandoc to work

Change paths in NotionToWord.py (selenium) and add your credentials and notion page where prompted.

In MDtoWordPS.ps1 change directories, download and use an empty folder for extraction etc. The ps script uses select -first 1 so can become weird if using a folder with several items and not sorted as I do
